## Running the Application (Manual)

If you prefer to run services manually in separate terminals:

You need to run **3 services** in separate terminals:

### Terminal 1: Node.js Backend

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

The API server will run on `http://localhost:5001`

### Terminal 2: Python ML Service

```bash
cd backend
python ml-service.py
```

The ML service will run on `http://localhost:5002`

### Terminal 3: React Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The React app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Map View** (default): 
   - Hover over station markers to see availability and predictions
   - Markers are color-coded: 🟢 Green (5+ bikes), 🟡 Yellow (1-5 bikes), 🔴 Red (empty)
   - Click markers for detailed popups

2. **List View**:
   - Click "List View" in navigation
   - Search stations by name
   - Sort by name, bikes available, docks, or capacity
   - Click "View" to see station details

3. **Detail View**:
   - Click any station to see comprehensive information
   - Real-time availability
   - ML demand prediction
   - Visual availability bars

4. **Rebalancing View**:
   - Click "Rebalancing" in navigation to access bike rebalancing recommendations
   - AI-powered system identifies stations requiring rebalancing
   - Shows optimal bike transfer routes between stations
   - Includes distance, quantity, and priority information

## Rebalancing Algorithm

The rebalancing feature uses a **surplus-based algorithm** that combines real-time availability data with ML demand predictions to generate intelligent bike redistribution recommendations.

### How It Works

#### 1. **Identify Recipients (Stations Needing Bikes)**

The algorithm identifies stations that will likely run out of bikes soon:

```
Deficit = Predicted Demand - Current Available Bikes
```

A station becomes a **recipient** if:
- `Deficit ≥ 3 bikes` (configurable threshold)
- It has available docks to receive bikes
- Current bikes are insufficient to meet predicted hourly demand

**Example**: 
- Station has 2 bikes available
- ML predicts 8 bikes will be needed in the next hour
- Deficit = 8 - 2 = 6 bikes → **Needs rebalancing**

#### 2. **Identify Donors (Stations With Surplus Bikes)**

The algorithm finds stations with excess bikes that can spare them:

```
Surplus = Current Available Bikes - (Predicted Demand + Safety Buffer)
```

A station becomes a **donor** if:
- `Surplus ≥ 8 bikes` (configurable threshold)
- It has more bikes than predicted demand + buffer
- Bikes can be safely removed without hurting availability

**Example**:
- Station has 25 bikes available
- ML predicts 5 bikes will be needed in the next hour
- Safety buffer = 5 bikes
- Surplus = 25 - (5 + 5) = 15 bikes → **Can donate bikes**

#### 3. **Match Recipients with Nearby Donors**

For each recipient station:
1. **Find nearby donors** within 1 km radius (configurable)
2. **Calculate distance** using Haversine formula
3. **Sort by proximity** (closer donors preferred)
4. **Determine transfer quantity**:
   ```
   Bikes to Move = min(Deficit, Donor Surplus, Available Docks)
   ```
5. **Generate recommendation** with route details

#### 4. **Prioritization**

Recommendations are sorted by urgency:
- Higher deficit = Higher priority
- Closer matches = Better efficiency
- Larger transfers = More impact

### Configuration Parameters

You can tune the algorithm in `frontend/src/components/RebalancingView.jsx`:

```javascript
const deficitThreshold = 3;   // Min bikes needed to flag recipient
const donorMinSurplus = 8;    // Min surplus to qualify as donor
const safetyBuffer = 5;       // Buffer kept at donor stations
const maxDistance = 1.0;      // Max distance for matches (km)
```

### Example Scenario

**Recipient Station** (Downtown Crossing):
- Current bikes: 1
- Predicted demand: 7 bikes/hour
- Deficit: 6 bikes 

**Donor Station** (Park Street - 0.3km away):
- Current bikes: 22
- Predicted demand: 3 bikes/hour
- Surplus: 14 bikes 

**Recommendation**:
> Move **6 bikes** from Park St → Downtown Crossing  
> Distance: 0.3 km | Priority: High

### ML Integration

The rebalancing algorithm relies on **accurate demand predictions** from your ML model:

- **With Real Model**: Uses your trained XGBoost model for precise hourly demand forecasts
- **With Mock Data**: Uses simplified time-based heuristics (for testing/demo)

For best results, deploy your trained model following the [Deployed Model Guide](deployed_model_guide.md).

### Benefits

 **Proactive**: Prevents stockouts before they occur  
 **Efficient**: Matches based on proximity and capacity  
 **Data-Driven**: Uses ML predictions instead of static rules  
 **Scalable**: Analyzes all 590+ stations in real-time  
 **Actionable**: Provides specific transfer quantities and routes

## API Endpoints

### Backend (Port 5000)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/stations` | GET | All station information |
| `/api/stations/status` | GET | Real-time status for all stations |
| `/api/stations/:id/status` | GET | Status for specific station |
| `/api/predict` | POST | ML prediction for demand |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |

### ML Service (Port 5001)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/predict` | POST | Generate demand prediction |
| `/predict` | POST | Generate demand prediction |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |

### Historical Data Service (Port 5003)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/historical/:id/:range` | GET | Historical data (hourly, daily, weekly) |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |

## ML Model Integration

### Using a Trained Model

1. Copy your trained model file to `backend/models/best_model.pkl`

2. The model should be a scikit-learn compatible model (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.) saved with `joblib` or `pickle`

3. The ML service will automatically load it on startup

### Mock Predictions

If no model is found, the service will return mock predictions based on simple heuristics (time of day, day of week). A warning will appear in the UI.
